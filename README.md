**An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns**
Downloaded, cleaned, and analyzed  Louise's Project Campaigne Data. Using this data, I practiced and learned how to use filters, create charts, pivot tables, pivot charts, formatting, vlookups/methods of searching, and statistics and visualization tools and formulas.

These charts and conclusions below were found through performing the Module 1 Skill Drills. Please view the excel document, KickStarter Data_Louise Hsu to find the work and how the charts were created in the various sheets.
