####**An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns**

Downloaded, cleaned, and analyzed  Louise's Project Campaigne Data. Using this data, I practiced and learned how to use filters, create charts, pivot tables, pivot charts, formatting, vlookups/methods of searching, and statistics and visualization tools and formulas. 

---

These charts and conclusions below were found through performing the Module 1 Skill Drills. Please view the excel document, **KickStarter Data_Louise Hsu** to find the work and how the charts were created in the various sheets.   

- **Parent Category Chart**
![Parent Category Outcome - unfiltered](https://github.com/louise-hsu/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Parent%20Category%20Outcome%20-%20unfiltered.png)
**Conclusion:** From the Parent Category Chart, we can see that theatre campaigns are the most popular. It contains the most successful and failed campaigns compared to the other parent categories. 

- **Parent Category Chart - US**
![Parent Category Outcome - filtered US](https://github.com/louise-hsu/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Parent%20Category%20Outcome%20-%20filtered%20US.png)
**Conclusion:** Looking at only the US Parent Category Chart, theatre is still the most popular parent category campaign, following the trend of popularity of theatre amount all countries. There were 525 successful theater campaigns in the United States.

-  **Parent Category Outcomes - Theatre**

- **Subcategory Outcome - Plays**

- **Outcomes Based on Launched Date**
![Outcomes Based on Launch Date](https://github.com/louise-hsu/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Date.png)
**Conclusion:** The most successful Kickstarter campaigns were started in May, and  December did not show a great time to launch a campaign.

- **Outcomes Based on Launched Date - Theatre**
![Outcomes Based on Launch Date - filtered theatre](https://github.com/louise-hsu/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Date-%20filtered%20theatre.png)

**Conclusion:** By filtering the Outcomes Based on Launched Date to only Theatre, we can determine that theater is a popular and successful type of campaign overall. Theater follows the overall trend of increased successful campaigns that began in June, but that tapers off by the end of the year. 

- **Great Britain Musical Box and Whisker**
![Box and Whisker- GB musical](https://github.com/louise-hsu/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Box%20and%20Whisker-%20GB%20musical.png)

**Conclusion:** The mean campaign goal is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
