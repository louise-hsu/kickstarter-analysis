### **An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns** 

Downloaded, cleaned, and analyzed  Louise's Project Campaigne Data. Using this data, I practiced and learned how to use filters, create charts, pivot tables, pivot charts, formatting, vlookups/methods of searching, and statistics and visualization tools and formulas. 

---

These charts and conclusions below were found through performing the Module 1 Skill Drills. Please view the excel document, **KickStarter Data_Louise Hsu** to find the work and how the charts were created in the various sheets.   

- **Parent Category Chart**
![Parent Category Outcome - unfiltered](https://github.com/louise-hsu/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Parent%20Category%20Outcome%20-%20unfiltered.png)

**Conclusion:** From the Parent Category Chart, we can see that theatre campaigns are the most popular. It contains the most successful and failed campaigns compared to the other parent categories. 

- **Parent Category Chart - US**
![Parent Category Outcome - filtered US](https://github.com/louise-hsu/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Parent%20Category%20Outcome%20-%20filtered%20US.png)

**Conclusion:** Looking at only the US Parent Category Chart, theatre is still the most popular parent category campaign, following the trend of popularity of theatre amount all countries. There were 525 successful theater campaigns in the United States.

-  **Parent Category Outcomes - Theatre**
![Parent Category Outcome- filtered theatre](https://github.com/louise-hsu/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Parent%20Category%20Outcome-%20filtered%20theatre.png)

**Conclusion:** This chart only looks at the parent category Theatre. A little less than 2/3 of theatre campaigns are successful. A little more than 1/3 of theatre campaigns are failed. Overall, theatre campaigns do realitively well.  

- **Subcategory Outcome - Plays**
![Subcategory Outcome- filtered plays](https://github.com/louise-hsu/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Subcategory%20Outcome-%20filtered%20plays.png)

**Conclusion:** Plays is a subcategory of theatre. Plays follows the overall trend of theatre, where a little less thn 2/3 of the campaigns are successful and a little more than 1/3 of campaigns are failed. 

- **Outcomes Based on Launched Date Line**
![Outcomes Based on Launch Date Line](https://github.com/louise-hsu/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Date%20Line.png)

**Conclusion:** The most successful Kickstarter campaigns were started in May, and  December did not show a great time to launch a campaign.

- **Outcomes Based on Launched Date - Theatre**
![Outcomes Based on Launch Date - filtered theatre](https://github.com/louise-hsu/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Date-%20filtered%20theatre.png)

**Conclusion:** By filtering the Outcomes Based on Launched Date to only Theatre, we can determine that theater is a popular and successful type of campaign overall. Theater follows the overall trend of increased successful campaigns that began in June, but that tapers off by the end of the year. 

- **Great Britain Musical Box and Whisker**
![Box and Whisker- GB musical](https://github.com/louise-hsu/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Box%20and%20Whisker-%20GB%20musical.png)

**Conclusion:** The mean campaign goal is around £4,000, while the mean campaign pledged is less than £2,000. Louise should change her goal amount to be more realistic because the £4,000 lies  outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged. A realistic goal would be around £1,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.

### **Challenge**

These charts and conclusions were created, and can be found in the excel document **Module 1 Challenge _ Louise Hsu**. I kept the challenge separate, in order to keep the document more organized and less cluttered. 

- Outcomes Based on Goal
![Outcomes Based on Goal](https://github.com/louise-hsu/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Goal.png)

- Outcomes Based on Launch Date

![Outcomes Based on Launch Date](https://github.com/louise-hsu/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Date.png)

**NEW CONCLUSIONS:** 
1. We can conclude that campaigns with goals less than $1000 are most likely to be successful, and less likely to fail. From Goals of $10000-44999, the success of the campaign is less visibility noticeable, however looking at the percentage of success and fail rates. The percentage of successful campaigns decrease as the goal amount increases, and the precentage of failed campaigns increase as the goal mount increases. Campaigns with goals greater than $44999, the success of the campaign decreases and tends to have a increased failed amount. 
2. Most campaigns were launched in May and June. More campaigns that were launched in May and June were successful, and  decreased/tapered off as the year went on. The most failed and least successful campaigns were launched in December. It seems that the what determines if a campaign is successful or failed is the launch month. 
3. Looking at an earlier chart, Outcomes Based on Launch Date - theatre, we can conclude that theatre follows tred of  of increased successful campaigns that began in May-June, but that tapers off by the end of the year.
